##Today's learning journey continues, I went through everything that I learnt in the previous tutorial, changed somethings and tried out new things. 

##For today, I learnt how to add Images to your app as an Asset Image. To do this, you simply download an image to the PC, u create a new Directory called images and then u drag and drop downloaded picture into the new images Directory created, you then go to the pubspec.yaml file added
the assets propertie and the location of the images directory, then in my main.dart file I have to the apply a little change to the image property: to get the images from an AssetImage and not as a Network Image, I then picked in the asset name and the asset directory and that's all
Find the code below to understand:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        backgroundColor: Colors.blueGrey[900],
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("I am Rich"),
          backgroundColor: Colors.blueGrey[900],
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Image(
            image: AssetImage('Images/diamond.png'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
Finally I learnt how to add an app icon to an app.
